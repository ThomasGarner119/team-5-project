## Abstract
This project aims to democratize complex environmental data by developing an interactive, publicly accessible application that visualizes the environmental impact of global food production. Leveraging the "Environment Impact of Food Production" dataset sourced from Kaggle, the application will simplify and present key insights on the land usage, freshwater withdrawal, and carbon footprint associated with the world's 43 most commonly produced foods. The core objective is to translate this detailed, quantitative data into simplified, actionable breakdowns designed for consumer education and public outreach. By clearly illustrating the negative environmental consequences—specifically detailing the resource consumption across diverse food items—this tool will empower the average citizen to better understand their dietary footprint and support sustainable consumption choices.
